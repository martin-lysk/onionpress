# OnionPresss

**Run your own website from your Mac. Just Works. Free, forever.**

onionpress is a macOS application that bundles WordPress with a Tor onion service, giving you an easy and free self-hosted web server accessible even when you are on a private network.

⚠️ This is **not** a securely-anonymous publishing tool-- it is a fun and easy-to-use wordpress that works on your own network

## Features

- 💻 **Easy and Free Self-Hosted**: Run your own web server without monthly hosting fees or technical complexity
- 🧅 **Tor Onion Service**: Your WordPress site is automatically configured as a Tor onion service (requires website visitors to use Tor or Brave browsers)
- 🔐 **End-to-End Encrypted**: Built-in encryption without needing HTTPS certificates or SSL setup
- 🌐 **No DNS Registration Needed**: Your .onion address works immediately - no domain registration, no DNS configuration
- 🏠 **Works Behind Firewalls**: Runs on home, school, or work networks even behind firewalls or NAT - no port forwarding required
- ✨ **Custom Onion Address Prefixes**: All installations generate addresses starting with "op2" for easy identification
- 📚 **Internet Archive Integration**: Automatically submits posts to be archived and installs the [Wayback Machine Link Fixer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/internet-archive-wayback-machine-link-fixer/) plugin to submit links from posts to be archived.   Registers the onionpress's .onion address so that when onionpress is offline, the URL requests are fulfilled by the Wayback Machine.
- 🐳 **Cyber Security from hacking**: Uses Docker containers inside a VM for easy management and isolation
- 📱 **Menu Bar App**: Simple menu bar interface to control your site
- 🚀 **One-Click Install**: Download the DMG, drag to Applications, and launch
- 🌐 **Tor-Only Access**: Your site is only accessible through Tor (e.g. Tor and Brave Browsers)

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- Internet connection

## Installation

1. Download the latest `onionpress.dmg` from the [releases page](https://github.com/brewsterkahle/onionpress/releases)
2. Open the DMG and drag `OnionPress.app` to your Applications folder
3. Launch OnionPress from Applications
4. On first launch:
   - The app will generate your onion address (starting with "op2") - takes < 1 second
   - The app will initialize its bundled container runtime (Colima) - takes ~2-3 minutes
   - It will download WordPress, MariaDB, and Tor container images (~1GB)
   - Total 1-time setup: 3-5 minutes depending on your internet connection
   - Launching the site is about a minute.

### macOS Security Warning

Since this app is not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS on first launch. This is normal for open-source software.

**Method 1 - System Settings (Recommended):**

1. Open the app when in your Applications folder - you'll see a security warning.  Hit Done.
2. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll down and click **"Open Anyway"** next to the OnionPress warning
4. Click **"Open Anyway"** in the confirmation dialog, and enter your computer's password

**Method 2 - Right-Click:**

1. Right-click (or Control-click) on the OnionPress app in you Application folder
2. Select **"Open"**
3. Click **"Open"** in the dialog

**Method 3 - Terminal (Advanced):**

If you're comfortable with the terminal, you can remove the quarantine flag:


```bash
# After moving to Applications folder
xattr -cr /Applications/OnionPress.app
```

This removes macOS's quarantine attribute and allows the app to launch without warnings.

## Usage

### Menu Bar Controls

Once installed, OnionPress appears in your menu bar with an onion icon:

- 🟣 **Purple** = running and available
- 🟡 **Yellow** = starting or reconnecting
- 🔴 **Red** = stopped or offline

Menu items:

- **Copy Onion Address**: Copy your .onion URL to clipboard
- **Open in Browser**: Open your site in Tor Browser, Brave, or your default browser with the OnionPress extension
- **Start / Stop / Restart**: Control the WordPress service
- **View Logs**: Open the OnionPress log in the built-in log viewer
- **View Web Usage Log**: See WordPress access logs (who's visiting your site)
- **Settings...**: Open configuration file for customization
- **Backup...**: Create a full backup (Tor keys, database, wp-content) as a zip file
- **Restore...**: Restore from a backup zip file
- **Check for Updates...**: Check for new app versions and update WordPress, MariaDB, and Tor container images
- **About OnionPress**: Version info and credits
- **Uninstall...**: Remove OnionPress and all data (prompts for backup first)

### Keeping Your Site Updated

**Manual Updates** (Recommended):
Click "Check for Updates..." in the menu to:

1. Check for new OnionPress app versions
2. Download updated WordPress, MariaDB, and Tor container images
3. Apply security patches and new features

**Automatic Updates** (Optional):
Enable automatic Docker image updates on launch by editing `~/.onionpress/config`:


```bash
UPDATE_ON_LAUNCH=yes
```

When enabled, onionpress will check for and download updated container images each time you launch the app. This ensures you have the latest security patches without manual intervention.

**Note**: Updated container images take effect the next time the service is started.

### Launch on Login

Have your WordPress site start automatically when you log in to macOS by editing `~/.onionpress/config`:


```bash
LAUNCH_ON_LOGIN=yes
```

When enabled:

- OnionPress automatically launches when you log in
- Your WordPress site starts automatically in the background
- The menu bar app appears and shows your status

The app automatically syncs this setting with macOS login items. You can also manage this in **System Settings → General → Login Items**.

**Default**: Disabled (manual launch required)

### Accessing Your Site

1. Your onion address is displayed in the menu bar dropdown (starts with "op2" for easy identification)
2. Install [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) to access .onion sites
3. Copy your onion address and paste it into Tor Browser
4. Complete the WordPress setup wizard

**Address Prefix Customization**: You can customize the prefix in `~/.onionpress/config` before first launch. See the config file for details on generation times for different prefix lengths.

### Backup & Restore

OnionPress can create a full backup of your site including Tor keys (your .onion address), the WordPress database, and all wp-content (themes, plugins, uploads).

**To backup:**

1. Click "Backup..." in the menu bar
2. Enter your WordPress admin credentials (the password encrypts the backup)
3. Choose a save location
4. A zip file is created containing everything needed to restore

**To restore:**

1. Click "Restore..." in the menu bar
2. Select a backup zip file
3. Enter the password used when the backup was created
4. Your site, onion address, and all content will be restored

⚠️ **Security Note**: Backup files contain your Tor private key. Anyone with this file and the password can restore your exact onion address. Store backups securely.

### Internet Archive Wayback Machine Link Fixer

OnionPress automatically installs and activates the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine Link Fixer plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/internet-archive-wayback-machine-link-fixer/), which helps combat link rot by:

- Automatically scanning your posts for outbound links
- Creating archived versions in the Wayback Machine
- Redirecting to archived versions when links break
- Archiving your own posts on every update

**The plugin is enabled by default.** To disable automatic installation, edit `~/.onionpress/config` before first launch:


```bash
INSTALL_IA_PLUGIN=no
```

For increased daily link processing, you can add your free Archive.org API credentials in the plugin settings after setup.

### Recommended WordPress Plugins for Tor Onion Services

These plugins are optimized for the Tor network's slower speeds and privacy-focused audience:

#### Performance & Optimization (Essential for Tor)

- **[WP Super Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/)** or **[W3 Total Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/)** - Critical for caching to improve response times over Tor's slower connections
- **[Autoptimize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/)** - Minifies and concatenates CSS/JavaScript to reduce HTTP requests and data transfer
- **[EWWW Image Optimizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/)** - Compresses images locally without cloud dependencies
- **[Lazy Load](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rocket-lazy-load/)** - Only loads images when scrolling, reducing initial page load time

#### Privacy & Self-Hosted Alternatives

- **[Simple Local Avatars](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-local-avatars/)** - Replaces Gravatar with local avatars (no external service calls)
- **[Koko Analytics](https://wordpress.org/plugins/koko-analytics/)** - Privacy-friendly, cookieless analytics (self-hosted, GDPR-compliant)
- **[Simple Location](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-location/)** - Uses OpenStreetMap instead of Google Maps
- **[ActivityPub](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/)** - Connect your WordPress site to the Fediverse for decentralized social networking

#### Security & Anti-Spam

- **[WP Cerber Security](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-cerber/)** or **[Wordfence Security](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/)** - Rate limiting and login protection
- **[CleanTalk](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cleantalk-spam-protect/)** - Effective spam protection that works well with Tor users
- **[Math Captcha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-math-captcha/)** - Self-hosted CAPTCHA alternative (avoid Google reCAPTCHA which blocks many Tor users)
- **[Disable Comments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/)** - Reduces spam attack surface if comments aren't needed

#### Content Security

- **[HTTP Headers](https://wordpress.org/plugins/http-headers/)** - Add security headers and control referrer policies
- **[Content Security Policy Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/content-security-policy-manager/)** - Prevents loading of external resources for better security

**Installation tip**: Install these plugins through the WordPress admin interface after completing initial setup. Focus on performance plugins first to optimize for Tor's network characteristics.

### Local Testing

For testing purposes, your WordPress site is also available at:

- [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (only accessible from your Mac)

## Architecture

onionpress uses:

- **WordPress**: Latest official WordPress container
- **MariaDB**: Latest MariaDB for the database
- **Tor**: Onion service container that exposes WordPress as a .onion site
- **mkp224o**: Onion address prefix generator (generates addresses with custom prefixes)
- **Colima**: Bundled container runtime using Apple's virtualization framework
- **Lima**: VM management layer (bundled)
- **Docker CLI**: Container management tools (bundled)

All data is stored in:

- `~/.onionpress/` - Application data, logs, config, and Colima VM
- Docker volumes for WordPress, database, and Tor keys

## Building from Source

To build the DMG installer:


```bash
cd onionpress
./build/build-dmg.sh
```

This will create `onionpress.dmg` in the `build/` directory.

## Troubleshooting

### "macOS version too old"

OnionPress requires macOS 13 (Ventura) or later for Apple's native virtualization framework.

### Containers won't start

Check the logs via the menu bar app or run:


```bash
tail -f ~/.onionpress/onionpress.log
tail -f ~/.onionpress/colima/colima.log
```

### Onion address not generating

Wait 30-60 seconds for Tor to generate your onion address. Check logs if it takes longer.

## Security Notes

- Change the default WordPress admin password immediately after installation
- Your site is only accessible via Tor by default (port 8080 is localhost-only for testing)
- Keep WordPress and plugins updated regularly

## Uninstalling

1. Click Uninstall from the menu bar app
2. Quit OnionPress
3. Move `OnionPress.app` to Trash
or
4. Quit OnionPress
5. Move `OnionPress.app` to Trash
6. Remove data directory: `rm -rf ~/.onionpress`
7. Remove Docker volumes:

```bash
docker volume rm onionpress-tor-keys onionpress-wordpress-data onionpress-db-data
```

1. Reboot
